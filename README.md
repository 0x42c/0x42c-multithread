0x42c
=====

0x42c is an operating system and kernel for DCPU-16.  It is assembled with [DCPU-16 Toolchain](https://github.com/DCPUTeam/DCPUToolchain).  To build it yourself, use either the appropriate script in /build or clone it into a folder called "kernel.mt" inside the folder where you have cloned DCPU-16 Toolchain and build it as part of CMake.
