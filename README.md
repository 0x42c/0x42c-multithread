0x42c
=====

0x42c is an operating system and kernel for DCPU-16.  It is assembled with [organic](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/organic).  To build it yourself, use the appropriate script in /build.  If you're on Linux or Mac, install Mono first.  On Linux, this is usually the "mono-complete" package.
